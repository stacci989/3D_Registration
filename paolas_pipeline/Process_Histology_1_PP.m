% this takes images from folder_processed_images ([save_folder/processed]),
% and allows you to rotate, flip, sharpen, crop, and switch their order, so they
% are in anterior->posterior or posterior->anterior order, and aesthetically pleasing
% 
% it also pads images smaller than the reference_size and requests that you
% crop images larger than this size
%
% note -- presssing left or right arrow saves the modified image, so be
% sure to do this even after modifying the last slice in the folder
